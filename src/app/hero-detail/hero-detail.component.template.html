          @NOTE: If the app imported collection modules, such as PaperElementsModule,
          [emitChanges] and [ironControl] must not be added to elements that the collection provides selectors for.
            * Add the [emitChanges] directive to all custom elements using two-way data binding.
            * Add [ironControl] to control elements that should work in Angular forms.
